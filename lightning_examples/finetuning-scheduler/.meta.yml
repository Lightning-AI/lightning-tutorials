  This notebook introduces the FinetuningScheduler callback and demonstrates the use of FinetuningScheduler to finetune
  a small foundational model on the [RTE](https://huggingface.co/datasets/viewer/?dataset=super_glue&config=rte) task
  of [SuperGLUE](https://super.gluebenchmark.com/) with iterative early-stopping defined according to a user-specified
  schedule. It uses HuggingFace's ``datasets`` and ``transformers`` libraries to retrieve the relevant benchmark data
  and foundational model weights.
requirements:
  - transformers
  - datasets
  - scikit-learn
  - sentencepiece
accelerator:
  - GPU
