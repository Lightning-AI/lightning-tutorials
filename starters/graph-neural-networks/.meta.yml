  This tutorial is a primer on Graph Neural Networks.
  We discuss basic layers such as Graph Convolutions and Graph Attention Layer.
  Further, we apply GNNs to semi-supervised node classification and molecule categorization.
  This notebook is part of a lecture series on Deep Learning at the University of Amsterdam.
