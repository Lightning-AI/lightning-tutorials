description: 'In this tutorial, we implement an autoregressive likelihood model for
  the task of image modeling.

  Autoregressive models are naturally strong generative models that constitute one
  of the current

  state-of-the-art architectures on likelihood-based image modeling,

  and are also the basis for large language generation models such as GPT3.

  We will focus on the PixelCNN architecture in this tutorial, and apply it to MNIST
  modeling.

  This notebook is part of a lecture series on Deep Learning at the University of
  Amsterdam.
