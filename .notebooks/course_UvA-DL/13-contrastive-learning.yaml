description: 'In this tutorial, we will take a closer look at self-supervised contrastive
  learning.

  Self-supervised learning, or also sometimes called unsupervised learning, describes
  the scenario where we have given input data, but no accompanying labels to train
  in a classical supervised way.

  However, this data still contains a lot of information from which we can learn:
  how are the images different from each other?

  What patterns are descriptive for certain images?

  Can we cluster the images?

  To get an insight into these questions, we will implement a popular, simple contrastive
  learning method, SimCLR, and apply it to the STL10 dataset.

  This notebook is part of a lecture series on Deep Learning at the University of
  Amsterdam.
