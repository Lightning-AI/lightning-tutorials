description: 'In this tutorial, we will take a closer look at (popular) activation
  functions and investigate their effect on optimization properties in neural networks.

  Activation functions are a crucial part of deep learning models as they add the
  non-linearity to neural networks.

  There is a great variety of activation functions in the literature, and some are
  more beneficial than others.

  The goal of this tutorial is to show the importance of choosing a good activation
  function (and how to do so), and what problems might occur if we don''t.

  This notebook is part of a lecture series on Deep Learning at the University of
  Amsterdam.
