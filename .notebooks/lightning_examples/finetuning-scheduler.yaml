description: 'This notebook introduces the [Fine-Tuning Scheduler](https://finetuning-scheduler.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
  extension

  and demonstrates the use of it to fine-tune a small foundational model on the

  [RTE](https://huggingface.co/datasets/viewer/?dataset=super_glue&config=rte) task
  of

  [SuperGLUE](https://super.gluebenchmark.com/) with iterative early-stopping defined
  according to a user-specified

  schedule. It uses Hugging Face''s ``datasets`` and ``transformers`` libraries to
  retrieve the relevant benchmark data

  and foundational model weights. The required dependencies are installed via the
  finetuning-scheduler ``[examples]`` extra.
