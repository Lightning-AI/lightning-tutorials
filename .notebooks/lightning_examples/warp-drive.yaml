description: "This notebook introduces multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with
  WarpDrive (Lan et al. https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13976). WarpDrive is a flexible,
  lightweight, and easy-to-use open-source framework that implements end-to-end deep
  MARL on GPUs. WarpDrive enables orders-of-magnitude speedups compared to CPU-GPU
  implementations, using the parallelization capability of GPUs and several design
  choices to minimize communication overhead. WarpDrive also prioritizes user-friendliness
  - it has utility functions to easily build MARL environments in CUDA and quality-of-life
  tools to run end-to-end MARL using just a few lines of code, and is compatible with
  PyTorch.

  WarpDrive includes the following resources. code - https://github.com/salesforce/warp-drive
  documentation - http://opensource.salesforce.com/warp-drive/, and white paper -
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13976."
