description: 'This notebook describes the self-supervised learning method Barlow Twins.

  Barlow Twins differs from other recently proposed algorithms as it doesn''t

  fall under the category of either contrastive learning, or methods like knowledge

  distillation or clustering. The simplicity of the loss function and its effectiveness

  in comparison to the current state of the art makes Barlow Twins an interesting

  case study.
