  This tutorial covers using Lightning Flash and it's integration with PyTorch Forecasting to train an autoregressive
  model (N-BEATS) on hourly electricity pricing data. We show how the built-in interpretability tools from PyTorch
  Forecasting can be used with Flash to plot the trend and daily seasonality in our data discovered by the model. We
  also cover how features from PyTorch Lightning such as the learning rate finder can be used easily with Flash. As a
  bonus, we show hat we can resample daily observations from the data to discover weekly trends instead.
